# LLM-Interface

This project is a React + Vite template setup intended as the foundation for a user interface to interact with Large Language Models. While currently based on a minimal React starter, it's designed to evolve into a powerful LLM UI with modern tooling.

---

##  Current Setup

The project currently contains the following core files:
```
LLM-Interface/
├── public/ # Static assets
├── src/ # Source code for the React app
├── .gitignore
├── package.json
├── package-lock.json
├── vite.config.js
├── eslint.config.js
└── README.md
```

##  Intended Functionality (TBD)

Once fleshed out, this UI could support features like:

- **Chat Interface** — Input prompts and receive responses from LLMs.
- **Provider Switching** — Easily switch between LLM providers (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.).
- **Tool Integration** — Support for embedded tools, plugins, or agent workflows.
- **Streaming Output** — Real-time LLM response streaming.
- **Authentication & API Keys** — Secure management of provider keys.
- **Theming & UX Enhancements** — Dark mode, accessibility features, prompt templates.
